# Self-Organizing Maps

A self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to produce a low-dimensional representation of a higher dimensional data set. 

SOMs are a specific type of artificial neural network, but use a different training strategy compared to more traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs).

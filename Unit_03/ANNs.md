# Artificial Neural Networks

### What is a neural network (i.e., multilayer perceptron)?

Neural networks are machine learning models consisting of layers and neurons. The basic units are neurons (i.e., nodes), which are typically organized into layers.

### What is a neuron, and the math involved?

### What are neural network hyperparameters?

### How do neurons learn?

### The bias-variance trade-off
